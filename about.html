      <h2>About BookHaven</h2>
      <p>At <strong>BookHaven</strong>, we believe that every book is a doorway to a new world. Founded by a group of passionate readers and tech enthusiasts, our goal is to bring together a community that loves books just as much as we do.</p>

      <h3>Why We Exist</h3>
      <p>We started BookHaven because we were tired of hearing, “I don’t have time to read.” So we decided to build a cozy digital corner where books feel alive again — a place that inspires, entertains, and motivates people to read more and share what they love.</p>

      <h3>What You'll Find Here</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Curated book lists for every mood and genre</li>
        <li>Reader reviews and honest recommendations</li>
        <li>Weekly “Book of the Week” features</li>
        <li>Fun book facts and reading challenges</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Fun Fact</h3>
      <p>The average person reads 12 books a year. At BookHaven, we challenge you to beat that! Join our monthly challenges and share your journey.</p>
